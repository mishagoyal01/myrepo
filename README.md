# FACE DETECTION USING VGG16
In this project i have developed a neural network code for detecting faces.
the dataset is collected by me using libraries openCV , CV2, numpy. i have used the haarcascade frontal face xml file to train my 
code to detect only faces and wrote a croping function which crops the face and saves it.
further i used the concept of traqnsfer learning , which uses the pre trained layers and we add our layers on top of it.
i used preprocessing techniques to do the augmentation of the images.
the detailed code is attached.
